          <p>Turner never walked or talked.  He was never able to eat any of his 22 birthday cakes.  He never contemplated the meaning of life or why his consisted of so many medical tests and procedures.  But he had a smile and a laugh that would warm any heart and light the whole universe.  No one who witnessed it will ever forget.</p>
          <p>Turner lived in his world knowing a peace and contentment many never know.  He enjoyed being outdoors, water, playing with his toys, and little games those close to him learned how he played.  He loved roller coasters and motorcycle rides.  He especially liked his Biplane ride.  He looked like the Red Barron with his goggles and his scarf blowing in the wind.</p>
          <p>Some of Turner's greatest joys came from watching other children play and laugh.  I will forever see him standing on feeble legs, hanging on to a windowsill, looking out of the window with contentment and wonder, at a world that he never got to know nearly enough of.</p>
          <p>One of the many gifts we received from Turner is a glimpse of what is good in our world - Of the many people and organizations who come to help and dedicate their time and love to those who need it.  There have been too many to list here, but we are eternally grateful for all of you.  You are a blessing to our society.</p>
          <p>Special thanks to his home nurses Laura, Holly, and Carrie; to his teacher Ms Debbie, and to the staff and residents of Mount Macrina Manor, for the time you devoted to caring for Turner and helping our family.</p>
          <p>Turner was a pure soul who was entrusted to our care. We hope he found us worthy of the task, could see how proud we are of him, and knows how much we love and miss him.  Rest in peace Turner</p>
